Rerun generate stats python scirpt and fix errors

I've got the first values ready to go by looking at the minutes data generated in the minutes folder by my predictMinutes.py. After that I can run plotData.py to read the file and get a formula for prediciting minutes. I should add to this so that I have better predictions for minutes.
