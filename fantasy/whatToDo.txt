9/12/17:
I've got the first values ready to go by looking at the minutes data generated in the minutes folder by my predictMinutes.py. After that I can run plotData.py to read the file and get a formula for prediciting minutes. I should add to this so that I have better predictions for minutes.

formulae.txt (in output) is 'slope intercept r_squared'

use playerPredictions.py

the minutes numbers and points numbers are off. do an investigation to check out the predicted stats
