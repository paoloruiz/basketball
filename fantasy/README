RECENT CHANGES (9/12/17):
the predictMinutes file will be used to generate all files by minutes.
Need to extend this to work with all different files. probably by editing seasons.


the generate stats python file will generate a folder with all the data. the data is ordered by
*directory name* *file name* in stats

*SEASON.txt - 
from basketball-reference.com
rank player position age team games games started minutes played fg fga fgp 3p 3pa 3p% 2p 2pa 2p% ft fta ft% orb drb trb ast stl blk tov pf pts


A good way to look for trades is to use the single season to calculate in season stats, then use calcSeason with teams filled out for everyone

single season- calculates scores by adding z scores and multiplying times the weighting in the file. need to change year in the file to change

pre parse season - needs to be called when a new season is added to make it look nice, put in year to parse

calc season - calculate the z score above average totals for players and for overall team

parse seasons - predict the stats for next season. currently tries to use years 1990 to 2013, order is name, points, assists, rebounds, steals, block, rebounds, tos, fg, ft, tp
